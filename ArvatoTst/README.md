To test end-to-end functionality of the website and write automatic tests without documentation, I relied on generally accepted norms of the Black Box testing method.
 
 Cucumber is used to run tests.
 
 Gherking syntax is used for test Scenarios (.feature files in src\test\resources\ArvatoTst).
 
 To run UI and REST tests, please use Maven "mvn test" command.
